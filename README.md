# Machine Learning
Machine Learning Exercises done in the online course of Stanford University.

- [Exercise 1 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/RodrigoBorgesOliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex1)
  - Implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.
- [Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/RodrigoBorgesOliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex2)
  - Implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.
- [Exercise 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks](https://github.com/rodrigoborgesdeoliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex3)
  - Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
- [Exercise 4 - Neural Network Learning](https://github.com/rodrigoborgesdeoliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex4)
  - Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
- [Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance](https://github.com/rodrigoborgesdeoliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex5)
  - Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.
- [Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/rodrigoborgesdeoliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex6)
  - Use support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.
- [Exercise 7 - K-Means Clustering and PCA](https://github.com/rodrigoborgesdeoliveira/Machine-Learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex7)
  - Implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.
